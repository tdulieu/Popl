# Popl (Pure Object Programming Language)

**Popl** is a work-in-progress toy programming language initiated by Thierry Dulieu in late 2018.

There are no variables nor flow-control structures as such in the language. A Popl program only consists of *objects* and *actions* sent to these objects. **Popl** is mainly inspired by Smalltalk but aims to create more concise (and somewhat obfuscated, in the tradition of esoteric languages) code.
